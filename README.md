Project Name: Learning How to Code: Part 2

This project was an extension of the first project, which was to build a website. In this project, the object was to expand on our HTML, and CSS capabilities by making the "elements" on the site more active. This was done through the introduction of the placement of videos, animation, and link hover features.
 

Below are some of the technologies and techniques used, and their description: 

1) iframe was used to embed videos on the site. and keeping the sources API.

2) Animation and Transform with CSS: was used to modify the appearance of an element in the browser by translation, rotation or     other means. In this case, it was used to alter the opacity of "links" on the sites when users hover over the element.           Animations were used using the Keyframes property,  to allow the rotations of some objects on the site,  all while providing     these transformations to smoothly transition using the Transition property.

3)  One of the goals for this project was to make sure our file structure adhered to the  BEM method. that ment dividing up the      original index.css sheet into several folders, which equated to the blocks used in the CSS. Once the files were properly         assigned CSS sheets, the @import element was used to import all the style sheets onto the Index.css sheet.  this was an          important step because the index.html  documents only linked to the index.css sheet.  So to see the style changes the            @import was used to import all the information from all the style sheets in one place.
